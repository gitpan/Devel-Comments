IO::Capture version 0.05 does not handle feature 'say' correctly. 
The bug has been reported to the author. Meanwhile, a fix is needed. 

IO::Capture::Sayfix works around this bug: 

	IO::Capture::Stdout is loaded, if it's not already. 
	'say' is captured
	if the capture doesn't include the trailing newline, 
		then the workaround is loaded. 

The hope is that this will play equally well with the current version
	and any future version that does or does not fix the 'say' bug.
